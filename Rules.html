<h2>Starting the Game</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Decide Total Force Size</h3>
<p>Players agree on the size of their total force in the game. To do this, agree on a number of health points for each player’s total forces, then bring components (units or magic items) totaling that many health points to the game. Good total force sizes are 18, 24, 36 or 60 health points. Unless a particular game format specifically allows, the number of health points consisting of magic users can be no more than half of the total number of health points (rounded down) in each player’s total forces. Any component with a magic or Cantrip icon counts as a magic user or magic-generating item.</p>

<p>Regardless of the total force size, each player must bring two terrains: one will be the player’s home terrain, the other will be the player’s proposed frontier terrain.</p>

<p>You are also required to bring dragons to the game. To calculate how many dragons you must bring, take the total force size and divide by 24 (round up any fractions). These dragons can be any color(s) you wish. You cannot bring more than or less than the required number of dragons. Your dragons are set in your summoning pool, to your left.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Assemble Armies</h3>
<p>At the start of the game, divide your components into three armies. When assembling your armies, you may have no more than half the total number of health points (rounded down) of your total forces placed in a single army but you must have at least 1-health of units in each army. After initial army placement, this restriction is no longer in effect. So, later in the game, you can pull components into the reserve area and then regroup them into larger armies. You should build and designate your armies in secret, so the other players will not be able to make decisions based on your strategy. Put your Home army on the left, your Campaign army in the middle, and your Horde army on the right.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Set the Battlefield</h3>
<p>Players must choose one of the two terrain dice they brought and place it in front of themselves to be their home terrain. Then, players place their second terrain die in the center of the playing area as their proposed frontier terrain.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Determine Order of Play</h3>
<p>Reveal your forces at the same time as the other players. Then roll your entire horde army and add up all the maneuver and ID icon results. The player who rolls the most points of maneuver results may choose to play first or select the frontier terrain. If the player chooses to play first, then the one with the second highest total selects the frontier terrain. If the player who rolled the most maneuver results decides to select the frontier terrain, then the player with the second highest total would play first. Any of the proposed frontier terrain dice, even one proposed by another player, may be selected</p>

<h3>Step 5: Place Armies</h3>
<p>The first player places his or her armies as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The home army is placed at the player’s home terrain.</li>
  <li>The horde army is placed at another player’s home terrain.</li>
  <li>The campaign army is placed at any other terrain where the player does not already have an army.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second player then places his or her armies in the same manner, followed by the next player, and so on, until all players have placed their armies.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Determine Starting Distances</h3>
<p>Each player rolls their home terrain die to determine initial battle distances. The player that selected the frontier terrain rolls this die. Any results of an eight (8) are rolled again and any results of seven (7) are turned down to six (6).</p>

<h2>The Turn Sequence</h2>
<p>A turn consists of up to five phases, which must be conducted in this order: Initial Effects, Dragon Attacks, a First March, a Second March, and a Reserve Movement. When a player is conducting a turn they are called the marching player. The marching player has the option to perform none, one, two, three or four of these phases, except Dragon Attacks. If dragons are present at any terrain where the marching player has an army, then the dragons must do combat.</p>

<h3>Spell & Effect Expiration (beginning of turn)</h3>
<p>After your turn begins but before you can conduct your Initial Effects phase, all the spells you cast that expire “at the beginning of your next turn” immediately expire and any durational effects (ex. Black Dragon Breath) that expire “at the beginning of your next turn” also immediately expire.</p>

<h3>Initial Effects Phase</h3>
<p>There are several steps within the Initial Effects phase that must be resolved in this order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Racial Abilities: Feralization and Swamp Stalker mutation: see section on racial abilities.</li>
  <li>Eighth Face Special Location Icons: City, Temple. Dragons’ Lair, and Grove</li>
  <li>Royalty Die Abilities: Promotion or recruiting by a Kings’ Die</li>
</ol>
<p>The effects within a step can occur in any order the acting player chooses (e.g. Swamp Stalker mutation can occur before Feralization). Each step, however, is a separate occurrence. Hence, it is possible to affect a unit more than once during the Initial Effects phase</p>
